## Why?

### Language agnostic

You can run `vrsn` in a project in any (supported) language and it will work.

Currently supported version files:

| File | Languages |
| --- | --- |
| `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` | ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white) ![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-%237F52FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kotlin&logoColor=white) |
| `Cargo.toml` | ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white) |

Don't see your favourite version file type in that list?
See the [CONTRIBUTING guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to (easily) add
support!

If you're the type of person that jumps between projects in different languages
you don't need to remember the `yarn` or `poetry` commands for each different
project, just use `vrsn` and get on with the important stuff.

### Simple CI checks

Ensuring you properly version releases is important.

I've had to write semantic version checks in CI pipelines in different ways for
different languages in different jobs. Now I can just use `vrsn` and not have
to worry about solving the same problems again.

## Install

### Download from GitHub

Find the latest version for your system on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tx3stn/vrsn/releases).

### Build it locally

If you have go installed, you can clone this repo and run:

```bash
make install
```

This will build the binary and then copy it to `/usr/local/bin/vrsn` so it will be
available on your path. Nothing more to it.

### Run the Docker container

Get the Docker container from the
[GitHub container registry](https://github.com/tx3stn/vrsn/pkgs/container/vrsn).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tx3stn/vrsn:latest
```

See [Running in Docker](#running-in-docker) for more details.

### Use the CircleCI Orb

For ease of running checks in your CI this repo includes a CircleCI orb.
Just import the orb:

```yaml
orbs:
  vrsn: tx3stn/vrsn@volatile
```

Then use the `check-version` job in your workflow like:

```yaml
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - vrsn/check-version:
            filters:
              branches:
                ignore:
                  - main
```

For an example you can look at this repo's [CircleCI config](./.circleci/config.yml)
which uses the orb.

See the [CircleCI orb docs](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/tx3stn/vrsn)
for more specifics on how to customise the orb jobs to best suite your needs.

The orb is semantically versioned using the same number as the `vrsn` binary
and Docker container, so you can pin a specific version in your CI config or
use the `volatile` tag to always get the latest version of `vrsn`.

## Commands

### `--help`

Run `vrsn --help` for a full up to date usage guide to get started or
`vrsn [command] --help` if you want help with a specific command.

### `check`

Run `vrsn check` to automatically check versions on an existing git branch.

By default the `check` command can tell if you are on a branch that is not
the base branch (i.e. `main`) and will compare the version file on your current
branch with the version file on the base branch.

This command is super useful for running in CI, just run `vrsn check`, in your
pull request CI and `vrsn` will tell you if the version has been properly
bumped or not.

Name your base branch something other than `main`?
You can use the `--base-branch` flag to specify the name you use.

Want to run it from somewhere other than the root of your git repo? You can
use the `--was` and `--now` flags to pass in values from wherever you need to
grab them:

```bash
vrsn check --was $(<function to get previous value>) --now $(<function to get current value>)
```

You can use the `--file` flag to point at a file that is not in the root of the
git repo (like in a monorepo with independantly versioned services), e.g.:

```bash
vrsn check --file './services/service-name/VERSION'
```

### `bump`

Run `vrsn bump` to increment the current version file.
It will prompt you to select the bump type and then write the new valid semver
version in your version file.

If you want to avoid the interactive picker you can pass the increment level as
an argument to the `bump` command, e.g.:

```bash
vrsn bump patch
```

Want to automatically commit the version bump? Just use the `--commit` flag. ðŸ™Œ

Don't like the default commit message? Provide your own custom one with
`--commit-msg`.

```bash
version bump minor --commit --commit-msg 'custom bump version commit message'
```

You can use the `--file` flag to point at a file that is not in the root of the
git repo (like in a monorepo with independantly versioned services), e.g.:

```bash
vrsn bump --file './services/service-name/VERSION'
```

This approach allows you to easily increment multiple versions in bulk, just
write a script to iterate over each service that needs bumping and use the
`vrsn bump` command. e.g.:

```bash
find ./services -type f -name 'VERSION' -exec vrsn bump patch --file {} \
```

Use git tags rather than a version file? Pass the `--git-tag` flag to read from
the existing tags and write a new tag. e.g.:

```bash
vrsn bump --git-tag --tag-msg 'custom tag message'
```

### Accessible mode

The `vrsn bump` command with no arguments will spawn an interactive picker.
You can set an `ACCESSIBLE` environment variable which will drop the TUI interactive 
selection in favour of a standard prompt that should work better with screen reader
tools, e.g.:

```bash
ACCESSIBLE='true' vrsn bump
```

## Setting defaults in a config file

If you always want `vrsn` to use specific flags, you can set default values for
them in a config file at `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/vrsn.toml` or `$HOME/.config/vrsn.toml`.

An example config file can be found at [./.schema/vrsn.toml](./.schema/vrsn.toml).

Use this file to always `--commit` by default or to always use your own custom
`--commit-msg`.

## Running in Docker

To run `vrsn` in a docker container you just need to mount the repo as a
volume, and `vrsn` can do it's thing, **however** git's
[safe.directory](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config/2.35.2#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory)
settings would prevent `vrsn` from being able to use it's git based smarts ðŸ§ .

To deal with this a directory called `/repo` is set as a safe directory as part
of the Docker build process, and is configured as the container's working
directory so it's recommended you use that as the destination of the volume
mount. e.g.:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/repo vrsn:latest check
```

## CI usage examples

To auto increment a version in a dependabot pull request so you don't need to
manually do it:

1. Configure a [write access deploy key](https://circleci.com/docs/github-integration/#deploy-keys-and-user-keys)
in CircleCI, as the bump version command will commit the version bump to the branch.
You will need to pass the key fingerprint as a paramter to the `bump-version` job.
1. Add a workflow job, filtered on branches that begin with `dependabot`, e.g.:

```yaml
workflows:
  pull-request-build:
   jobs:
    - vrsn/bump-version:
       bump-type: patch
       ssh-key-fingerprint: fingerprint-of-your-key
       filters:
         branches:
           only:
             - /^dependabot\/.*/
```
